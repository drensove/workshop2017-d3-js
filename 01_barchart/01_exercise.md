# Practice - Getting Started with D3js - Simple Charts
* find a suitable editor for your OS (Sublime Text, Notepad++, if you are hardcore nerdy.. check vim and emacs ;) )
* install a webserver
    * on mac os and linux is a [python](https://www.python.org/) server already installed, you just need to start this server in the directory of your project 
    * command is ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer <portnumber>```
    * or if you use pyhton 3 ```python -m http.server <portnumber>``
    replace  ```<portnumber>``` with a four digit number
    * check your browser under  ```localhost:<portnumber>```
* copy the example of my github repository 
    you can also check out the complete repository. but make sure: everytime you make ```git pull``` it will have conflicts if you are also working in this directory.
* start the webserver in the directory of the example. note: you can only have one server with on port by the same time. if you need more server, you have to use different port numbers
* play around with the example  
    - change the numbers in the data
    - change the colors
    - have a look inside the inspector
* copy the example for the practice
    - again, play around
    - change the rectangles to circles, which attributes are the same, which are different
    - can you change it to a line graph? yes/no and why? 
    - where is the difference between a rectangle and a circle, which parts can you use, why do you have to change certain attributes or scales
    - try to use css for everything stylish and play around
